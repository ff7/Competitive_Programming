# Competitive_Programming

This repo will contain my jorney of problem solving in order to evolve as a student aswell as preparing me for some algorithm competitions I'm planning to participate.

Firstly I will solve problems from the USACO Training Gateway and Sphere Online Judge, available from anyone here:

I will also leave in this repo a handbook about competitive programming which my hopes are to help those of you who are interested in this field.
